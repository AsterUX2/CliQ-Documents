                      This verification process helps us identify fake users and
                      we believe we can provide security to our genuine users by
                      minimizing fake profiles in our app. Once the picture is
                      taken then the picture is matched with your profile
                      pictures that are uploaded and done manual and automatic

                      Some web browsers (including Safari, Internet Explorer,
                      Firefox and Chrome) have a “Do Not Track” (“DNT”) feature
                      that tells a website that a user does not want to have his
                      or her online activity tracked. If a website that responds
                      to a DNT signal receives a DNT signal, the browser can
                      block that website from collecting certain information
                      about the browser’s user. Not all browsers offer a DNT
                      option and DNT signals are not yet uniform. For this
                      reason, many businesses, including CliQ, do not currently
                      respond to DNT signals.

                      We want you to be aware of your privacy rights. Here are a
                      few key points to remember: <br />
                      Reviewing your information. Applicable privacy laws may
                      give you the right to review the personal information we
                      keep about you (depending on the jurisdiction, this may be
                      called right of access, right of portability or variations
                      of those terms). <br />
                      Updating your information. If you believe that the
                      information we hold about you is inaccurate or that we are
                      no longer entitled to use it and want to request its
                      rectification, deletion or object to its processing,
                      please contact our Customer Service Team. <br />
                      For your protection and the protection of all of our
                      users, we may ask you to provide proof of identity before
                      we can answer the above requests. <br />
                      Keep in mind, we may reject requests for certain reasons,
                      including if the request is unlawful or if it may infringe
                      on trade secrets or intellectual property or the privacy
                      of another user. If you wish to receive information
                      relating to another user, such as a copy of any messages
                      you received from him or her through our service, the
                      other user will have to contact our Privacy Officer to
                      provide their written consent before the information is
                      released. <br />
                      Also, we may not be able to accommodate certain requests
                      to object to the processing of personal information,
                      notably where such requests would not allow us to provide
                      our service to you anymore. For instance, we cannot
                      provide our service if we do not have your date of birth.
                      Uninstall. You can stop all information collection by an
                      app by uninstalling it using the standard uninstall
                      process for your device. If you uninstall the app from
                      your mobile device, the unique identifier associated with
                      your device will continue to be stored. If you re-install
                      the application on the same mobile device, we will be able
                      to re-associate this identifier to your previous
                      transactions and activities. <br />
                      Accountability. In certain countries, including in the
                      European Union, you have a right to lodge a complaint with
                      the appropriate data protection authority if you have
                      concerns about how we process your personal information.
                      The data protection authority you can lodge a complaint
                      with notably may be that of your habitual residence, where
                      you work or where we are established.
